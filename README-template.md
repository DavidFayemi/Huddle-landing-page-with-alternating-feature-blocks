### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="sectionA">
  <div class="sectionA--main">
    <header class="sectionA--header">
      Build The Community Your Fans Will Love
    </header>

    <p class="sectionA--paragraph">
      Huddle re-imagines the way we build communities. You have a voice, but so
      does your audience. Create connections with your users as you engage in
      genuine discussion.
    </p>
